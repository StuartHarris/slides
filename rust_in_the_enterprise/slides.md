# So what do enterprises care about?

- **Quality** — they want to build software that works
- **Sustainability** — they want to build software that lasts
- **Security** — they want to be secure
- **Cost/Speed** — they want it yesterday, and within budget
- **Control/Risk/Compliance** — they want to be in control of their software,
  reduce risk, and be compliant with regulations
- **Innovation/Talent/Culture** — they want to innovate, attract and retain
  talent, and build a culture of engineering excellence

---

# Quality

## Software that is _delightful_

This means:

- It does what it is supposed to do
- It is easy to use and accessible for everyone
- It is fast, reliable and secure
- It is maintainable, extensible and testable

# Where does the resistance come from?

- **Risk** — "We don't want to be the first to do this"
- **Cost** — "We don't have the budget"
- **Speed** — "We don't have the time"
- **Culture** — "We don't have the talent"

# How do we get there?

## Top down

- Find the open source owner (OSPO)
- Find a champion (and a project goal)
  - Might not be a technology champion
  - Would be great to have a product sponsor
- Run a 2-horse race

# How do we get there?

## Bottom up

- Learn it yourself
- Write some tools
- Start small and stay small
- Build a mini community, hold meetups
- Infect your organisation
